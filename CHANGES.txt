CHANGES for "Learning Core Audio: A Hands-On Guide to Audio Programming for Mac and iOS" sample code

August 29, 2012:

All projects:
-------------
Now that Xcode 4.4 has dropped support for OS X 10.6 as a base SDK, we have updated all the OS X project files to build for the OS X 10.7 SDK. The deployment target is still 10.6. iOS projects are still "Latest iOS", and work on iOS 5.1, the current public version as of this writing.

CH02_CAToneFileGenerator/
		main.m
-------------------------		
Changed line 106 from:
	NSLog (@"wrote %ld samples", sampleCount);
to
	NSLog (@"wrote %ld samples", sampleCount);
to match the bit-depth of the sampleCount argument
(thanks "jarryd")


CH07_AUGraphSineWave/
		main.c
----------------------
Changed line 96 from:
	input.inputProcRefCon = &player;
to
	input.inputProcRefCon = player;
to correct the pointer type of player, and eliminate a crash when the sleep() exits.
(thanks Stefan Frauenfelder and Dmitri Kharlamov)


CH10_iOSBackgroundingTone/
		CH10_iOSBackgroundingToneAppDelegate.m
-----------------------------------------------		
Changed line 63 from:
	(data)[frame] = (SInt16) (sin (2 * M_PI * (j / cycleLength)) * 0x8000);
to
	(data)[frame] = (SInt16) (sin (2 * M_PI * (j / cycleLength)) * SHRT_MAX);
to eliminate malformed waves at certain frequencies / sample rates.
(thanks Markus Boigner)
